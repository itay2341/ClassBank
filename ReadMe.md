Working with Classes

class 1: Bank
class 2: Account

Here we can:

1. To add a new account, every account has an unique "id" 
   and he has to bring at least 100 shekels. 
   Also he has to be with 3 or more letters in his name.

2. To close an Account (or searching)
3. To do withdraw if you have enough money
4. To deposit
5. To print how many members in the bank
6. To print all the Accounts

<!-- At the Bank class: adding, searching and closing Account, -->
<!-- printing number of Accounts and all Account, -->
<!-- And also the saving and loading -->

<!-- In the Account class I put 4 functions:
A constructor and printing function, and deposit and withdraw. -->

Using JSON I'm saving the data and loading it again.
